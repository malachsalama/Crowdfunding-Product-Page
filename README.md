This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR).

[Here](https://crowd-fund.netlify.app/) is the live solution.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Experience, Challenges and Learning
*I will be updating this periodically as I work on the todo tasks*

The CSS was fairly straightfoward and enjoyble. The modal required a little bit of work especially the modal states for checked items. The real struggle and timesuck for this challenge for me was the javascript for the buttons, input elements, managing the state of the numbers displayed on the homepage and the progress bar.

Overall, it was a great challenge and along the way I learnt a couple of things. I'll share a few:
- Always wrap `<input>` field in a `<form>` even if there isn't a submit button. It just gets easier to work with the input element for field and form validation.

- If there are multiple items that will change, make sure their corresponding identical items are sharing the same class. Do not add a id to them, makes things really hard later on.

- Create independent forms even if they work identically, its much easier to manipulate the form functions with shared functions if required.
  
### Pending tasks
 - Input validation only exists for max value, for min value it simply doesn't let user enter below certain value without helping the user understand why thats the case.
 - Change disabled button innerText to 'Out of stock' dynamically once the stands are out of stock, i.e below 0.
 - A fill color for the bookmark svg to distinguish whether or not the product is bookmarked
 - Dynamically update days left.
